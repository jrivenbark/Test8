Hey we are going to the beach!  Woo hoo.  Awsome.  To live?  Wooooo.  I wan to be a beach bum!

### Hear is a simple code example

{% highlight c# %}
int bob = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i;)
{
   bob = bob + i;
}
{% endhighlight %}

> *"*This is a blockquote.
> 
> This is the second paragraph in the blockquote.
>
> ## This is an H2 in a blockquote
> This is the last line*"*

Some of these words *are emphasized*.
Some of these words _are emphasized also_.

Use two asterisks for **strong emphasis**.
Or, if you prefer, __use two underscores instead__.
